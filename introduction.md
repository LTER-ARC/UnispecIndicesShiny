## User Instructions

This shiny application is built to visualize spectral reflectance data collected from the Arctic LTER terrestrial experimental plots at Toolik Lake from 2007-onward.

Navigate using the tabs in the top bar to see the same data plotted differently:

  1. To compare control plots across vegetation types
  2. Site-level comparison (data averaged by plot and then by block)
  3. Block-level comparison per site (data averaged by plot)
  4. Plot-level (each data point is a measurement)

Within each tab, use the options on the left to choose which Vegation Index (see definitions below) to plot what subset of data to visualize (i.e. years, dates, sites, treatments to view).

### Spectral Band Definitions:

By default, the MODIS band definitions are used to calculate indices.

  - Lorna reflectance:	570-680 nm
  - Lorna reflectance:	725-1000 nm
  - Red defined by ITEX:	560-680 nm 
  - NIR defined by ITEX: 	725-1000 nm
  - Blue defined by MODIS:	459-479 nm
  - Red defined by MODIS:	620-670 nm
  - NIR defined by MODIS:	841-876 nm
  - Blue defined by SKYE:	455-480 nm
  - Red defined by SKYE:	620-680 nm
  - NIR defined by SKYE:	830-880
  - Red defined by TFS GIS-drone micasense (2018): 640-680
  - NIR defined by TFS GIS-drone micasense (2018): 820-890
